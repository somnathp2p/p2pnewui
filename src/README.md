## Start Development Server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build for Production

If you want to create a build for a production environment you can simply run `npm run build` or `ng build --prod` and you will get static HTML and JS files in the `/dist` folder ready to be uploaded to any server.
